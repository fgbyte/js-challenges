//1. Find the Character Frequency
// Please write a JavaScript function called 'characterFrequency' that takes a string as an argument. Your function should return an object where the keys are unique characters in the string and the values are their respective frequencies (number of occurrences) in the input string. Your solution should be case insensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' are considered the same character. Try to make your solution as efficient as possible.

// Examples
// "Hello, World!"	{"h": 1, "e": 1, "l": 3, "o": 2, ",": 1, " ": 2, "w": 1, "r": 1, "d": 1, "!": 1}
// "AaabBC"	{"a": 3, "b": 2, "c": 1}
// "112233"	{"1": 2, "2": 2, "3": 2}

function characterFrequency(str: string): object {}
